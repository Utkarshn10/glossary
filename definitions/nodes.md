## Nodes

A node is the smallest unit of computer hardware in Kubernetes. Each node may be a virtual or physical machine, depending on the cluster.  

A node has the services necessary to run application containers and be managed from the master systems.A node is part of a cluster, or group, of nodes that works together in concert.

In a cloud native platform or app a node represents a single unit that can perform work. The nodes share resources with each other and act as a single powerful machine -- the cluster. A cluster keeps things moving by determining what runs on the clusterâ€™s worker nodes. These worker nodes run the services that support the containers inside of them, starting and stopping app activity all according to the cluster master requests.
